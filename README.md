# 🐉 Dungeons & Shenanigans

**Dungeons & Shenanigans** is a fantasy-themed 2D roleplaying game inspired by classic Dungeons & Dragons mechanics — with a twist. It features a powerful AI Grandmaster that dynamically narrates the story, controls NPCs, and responds creatively to player actions.

## 🎮 What I'm Building

This is a **React + TypeScript** web-based game where the player creates a character and explores a fantasy world using a top-down 2D tile-based map powered by **Phaser.js**. The game will feature:

- 🧙‍♂️ AI Dungeon Master: Narrates adventures, reacts to player choices, and drives the story.
- ✨ Character Creator: Choose your race, class, and personality traits.
- 🎲 Dice Mechanics: Roll classic D&D dice (like D20) for chance-based actions.
- 📜 Game Log & Chat: Interact with the AI Grandmaster using text (and voice in future versions).
- 🗺️ 2D Tile-Based Map: Navigate dungeons and encounter monsters and puzzles.
- 🔊 Music & Sounds: Dynamic fantasy background music and sound effects.
- 🎤 Voice-to-Text & AI Voice: Plan to add speech input and AI-generated character voices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3
- **AI (future)**: OpenAI / Hugging Face for storytelling & dialogue
- **Design Tools**: Figma (for UI mockups), Tiled (for map design)
